This package naturally propose to translate both its messages and its
documentation. You can either manually translate the files in po/bin
and po/pod and propose a pull request, or use the online interface at 
https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/po4a/

Refresh the local files (sync them to the actual material to translate),
with the following commands, from the top level:

 perl Build.PL
 ./Build postats
