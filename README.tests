"Testing can only prove the presence of bugs"
  -- Dijkstra

I'll try to add a test for each test found in po4a in order to ensure that
they won't surface again.

If the test suite repports errors, please join enough details so that I can
fix them. At least, provide me the detailed result of the test suite. For
that, run the following command:

  script -c 'perl Makefile.PL;make clean test TEST_VERBOSE=1'

It will produce a file called 'typescript', containing most of the details I
need. Please also repport the perl version used, the linux distribution, and
all details you think appropriate.


Thanks, Mt.
