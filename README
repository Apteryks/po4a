Po4a version 0.16
=================

The po4a (po for anything) project goal is to ease translations (and
more interestingly, the maintenance of translations) using gettext
tools on areas where they were not expected like documentation.

In po4a each documentation format is handled by a module. For now, we have a
module for the pod format (in which the perl documentation is written), the
good old man pages, and the documenta- tion of the kernel compilation
options. Some other modules are underway, like for sgml, xml or texinfo.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
