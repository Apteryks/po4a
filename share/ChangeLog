	changes from more testing within the po4a build.
	* doc/po4aman-display-po.xml,

	* README: trying to describe what I'm seeking here.
	* doc/po4a-build.xml: Prototype manpage for po4a-build
	* doc/po4a.config: po4a-build config file for it's own
	manpage translation, in due course.
	* po/.cvsignore: Ignore the POT
	* po4a-build: Switch to po4a-build as the script name and
	po4a-build.conf as the config file name. Comment out
	"debianism" of looking for debian/changelog.
	* po4a-build.conf: Internal conf file for eventual manpage
	generation and translation.
	* po4a-build.conf.example: SCRIPTS= unsupported - better done
	using the Makefile snippets, see README.

	POT files and updating of PO files for script output translation
	messages.
