			po4a-build - one-stop translation
			=================================

po4a allows translations to be merged into the source documents for
the generation of translated content but does not then go on to prepare
the translated output documents - typically the XML is translated but
no translated manpage is built.

The main reason is that the system to prepare that translated manpage
can be build-specific.

po4a-build is an attempt to provide a one-stop method for building both
translated and untranslated content *and* putting that content into the
final installation locations in a simple and flexible manner.

There is a lot to do to let po4a-build fit in with po4a itself more
easily. Currently, po4a-build is used as 'genmanpages' in two Debian
packages (svn-buildpackage and emdebian-rootfs) but some changes may
be needed to fit with a wider range of uses, particularly upstream rather
than native packages.

For now, the po4a-build manpage can be created just by running
po4a-build in this directory. The reliance on 'debian/changelog' is,
obviously, an inheritance from the 'genmanpages' script used in Debian
packages that formed the basis for po4a-build. In time, a better check
may be needed or po4a-build might become sufficiently intelligent that
it can work out what it needs to do.

Other files
===========

Packages wanting to use po4a-build often are not using autotools but
may be using just make. po4a-build has example files that can support
adding program output translation and these files can be made available
via po4a. Files include a Makefile suitable for use in the top level
po/ directory, to build, maintain and install translations of the
files described in po/POTFILES.in using variables defined in the
Makevars file, of which po4a-build provides two examples. (More to be
added, as necessary.)
