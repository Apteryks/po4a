** TransTractor.pm
 - process(): $self->addendum($file) || die "An addendum failed\n";
 - poheader()

** po-debconf:
 - change the pot header as documented in po4a(7) 

** Po.pm
 - close filehandle in write (and same in TransTractor.pm).
 - verbose => type in automatic comments

** Sgml.pm
 - get ride of nsgml
 - move the tag lists to an external file
